# CalculatriceGraphique

## Description of the project

First graphical project of openclassrooms' course named "Apprenez Ã  coder avec Java".

I've done this project in english so that a larger public should be able to understand it.

This project consists in creating a basic calculator as one could have on Windows without the scientifical part.

## What did I learn in this project

This project uses a lot of new concepts :
* The library *javax.swing* and *java.awt* with graphical objects such as *JFrame*, *JPanel*, *JButton* and *JLabel*;
* Inner classes that can use attributes from the outer class;
* *ActionListener* that listens the *JButton* to do a specific action when a user click on a button;
* Inheritance and *interface* implementation.

## Future work

* The division by 0 still requires some work to be perfectly managed.
* Successive different operations can fail.
